# ICT_1002_Python_Project (Covid19 Data Analyzer)

## Tkinter.py is the main file to run 


## Objectives
Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in a lot of application scenarios such as the data crawling, scripting, data analytics, machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. Thus, the objective of this project is to allow you to develop a Python program such that you can:
1. Learn more new Python programming skills through self-learning to deepen in your skills
2. Learn team collaboration using Python tools and libraries
3. Gain more hands-on experience in solving a real-world problem using Python

## Requirements
The overall instructions for every team to follow is provided as follows.
1. Figure out one interesting and innovative application scenario where data can help make a difference. Then you need to search for the corresponding datasets that can support your application. Below, we have provided you two sample project ideas and datasets. But you are free and encouraged to come out with your own applications and ideas in your project.
2. Develop the proper data parser and cleaner to extract the proper information from the data you have.
3. Build your own story about how to make sense of the datasets and perform some meaningful analytics with different visualization or user interfaces.
4. Provide some evaluations and comparisons if needed.

In particular, your system shall allow users to perform some basic features shown as below:

• Read data from an external data sources, e.g. txt, Jason, excel or other formats.

• Allow users to view the datasets.

• Allow users to search the data based on some criterion.

• Allow users to see some statistics information based on the data.

• Allow users to export some of the results.

• As some advanced features, you can identify your only way for pattern/anomaly detection, prediction or other analyses using advanced data science libraries like machine learning libraries.
